This is our Project 1 repo to analyse MTA data for the most signup.
Some of the objectives
1) simply see where the most traffic is
2) make a table or chart of Top five stations in terms of average daily turnstile entrances
3) find stations where the number of tourists is low and most riders are native New Yorkers  
4) stations with high and consistent usage on weekdays, and low utilization on the weekend [a]. 
5) Stations that are popular with tourists have less of a difference between weekend and weekday travel [b], 
6) or are much more chaotic and event-based [c].
7) build you a prioritizelist of stations that will give you the most native New Yorkers per street team unit. 
This can easily be broken down by day, in case there are slight differences among weekdays.
8) collapsed data to the day and station. This gives us some great information for daily scheduling.
9) we can build a model that allows more than one team to be deployed to very-high-volume stations [insert example or doodle seasonal or entrances
10) make some rough guesses about the people who are using the station, based on the weekly patterns of ridership
11) Geographic & demographic information about areas around stations
12) Design some A/B tests or similar experiments to gather data informed feedback 
13) design for you an optimizer that assigns deployments and collects signature results in real time
